# ☕ Heart & Hearth – Functional Café Website

This is a fully responsive, multi-page café website built as part of a group assignment for the Web Fundamentals module (WEB1201/WEB2014) at Sunway University. Developed in collaboration with my coursemates, the project emphasizes clean UI/UX, interactivity, responsiveness, and branding through custom HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
